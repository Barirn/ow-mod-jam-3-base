# Outer Wilds Mod Jam 3

For the third mod jam (theme COMMUNITY) all mods will take place in the same star system.

This compatibility mod will handle the obvious issues that will arise here:
- It will reconfigure orbits to ensure there is no overlap
- It will rearrange ship log entries to not overlap

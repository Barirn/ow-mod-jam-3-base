# Outer Wilds Mod Jam 3

For the third mod jam (theme COMMUNITY) all mods will take place in the same star system.

**This mod will be highly experimental during the jam as compatibility concerns are brought up!**

### Compatibility fixes covered:
- It will reconfigure orbits to ensure there is no overlap
- It will rearrange ship log entries to not overlap
- It will reposition static bodies to be in a ring around the sun (45 degrees up from the plane of the solar system)
- It will arrange Bramble dimensions in a plane underneath the sun (20km down)

If your entry has needs that aren't met by this, hit me up on the Discord server

      <Page>A temperate world, with obvious signs of inhabitation.</Page>
      <Page>Many beings have gathered here, for what purpose is unknown to me at this time.</Page>
      <Page>My Hearthian friend has told me that the being gathered here are known as "modders".</Page>
      <Page>I have invited one to visit my ship, as I am entirely unable to grasp what exactly a "mod" is.</Page>
      <Page>Unfortunately, I have not yet gleaned any useful info. This particular individual claims to have created the "mod" displayed here, whatever that means.</Page>

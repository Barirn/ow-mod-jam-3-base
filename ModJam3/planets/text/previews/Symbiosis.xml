      <Page>A dark shadowy world. Were it not for intermittent flashes of lightning, it would be largely invisible against the background of space.</Page>
      <Page>Unfortunately, this world is so nebulous and mysterious that even a Hearthian ship log cannot record data on it.</Page>
      <Page>Until ship logs can be obtained, we can learn nothing new here. Perhaps my Hearthian friend could <![CDATA[<color="orange">]]>modify<![CDATA[</color>]]> their ship in order to remedy this?</Page>

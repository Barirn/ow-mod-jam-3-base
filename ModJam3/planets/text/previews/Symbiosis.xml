      <Page>A dark shadowy world. Were it not for intermittent flashes of lightning, it would be largely invisible against the background of space.</Page>
      <Page>Unfortunately, this world is so nebulous and mysterious that even a Hearthian ship log cannot record data on it.</Page>
      <Page>Until ship logs can be obtained, we can learn nothing new here. Perhaps my Hearthian friend could <![CDATA[<color="orange">]]>modify<![CDATA[</color>]]> their ship in order to remedy this?</Page>
      <Page>(Bird refuses to add ship logs to their mod; ensure you have the Symbiosis Ship Logs mod by GameWyrm installed to track your progress here!)</Page>

      <Page>It seems however that their findings have left us with more questions than answers: Where did this "spokesperson" come from, what was their purpose, and why does this "Ernesto" character keep popping up everywhere?</Page>
